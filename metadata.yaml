summary: '"Two Secrets and A Man of His Word" by Hesba Stretton is a poignant novel
  likely written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around a tight-knit
  family consisting of Joanna, her invalid daughter Charlotte, and her husband Amos,
  who is a dedicated postman. As they navigate their humble lives, the narrative hints
  at deeper challenges that will test their bond and reveal secrets that may alter
  the course of their lives.  At the start of the narrative, we are introduced to
  Joanna''s charming cottage, emblematic of their simple yet fulfilling life filled
  with love and contentment. Joanna dotes on her daughter Charlotte, whose spinal
  condition confines her to the attic, while Amos finds joy in his routine as a rural
  postman. The tranquility of their life is shattered when Amos is late returning
  home after rescuing a drowning child, ultimately causing him a bout of rheumatic
  fever after he attempts to deliver important mail. Meanwhile, Joanna faces an impending
  crisis when she receives troubling news about their cottage''s ownership, revealing
  the precariousness of their situation and hinting at secrets that remain to be uncovered
  as the story progresses. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
